## Overview

**KTClaw** bridges the gap between powerful AI agents and everyday users. Built on top of [OpenClaw](https://github.com/OpenClaw), it transforms command-line AI orchestration into an accessible, beautiful desktop experience—no terminal required.

Whether you're automating workflows, managing AI-powered channels, or scheduling intelligent tasks, KTClaw provides the interface you need to harness AI agents effectively.

KTClaw comes pre-configured with best-practice model providers and natively supports Windows as well as multi-language settings. Of course, you can also fine-tune advanced configurations via **Settings → Advanced → Developer Mode**.

## Why KTClaw

Building AI agents shouldn't require mastering the command line. KTClaw was designed with a simple philosophy: **powerful technology deserves an interface that respects your time.**

| Challenge | KTClaw Solution |
|-----------|----------------|
| Complex CLI setup | One-click installation with guided setup wizard |
| Configuration files | Visual settings with real-time validation |
| Process management | Automatic gateway lifecycle management |
| Multiple AI providers | Unified provider configuration panel |
| Skill/plugin installation | Built-in skill marketplace and management |

### OpenClaw Inside

KTClaw is built directly upon the official **OpenClaw** core. Instead of requiring a separate installation, we embed the runtime within the application to provide a seamless "battery-included" experience.

We are committed to maintaining strict alignment with the upstream OpenClaw project, ensuring that you always have access to the latest capabilities, stability improvements, and ecosystem compatibility provided by the official releases.

---

## Features

### 🎯 Zero Configuration Barrier
Complete the entire setup—from installation to your first AI interaction—through an intuitive graphical interface. No terminal commands, no YAML files, no environment variable hunting.

### 💬 Intelligent Chat Interface
Communicate with AI agents through a modern chat experience. Support for multiple conversation contexts, message history, rich content rendering with Markdown, and direct `@agent` routing in the main composer for multi-agent setups.
When you target another agent with `@agent`, KTClaw switches into that agent's own conversation context directly instead of relaying through the default agent. Agent workspaces stay separate by default, and stronger isolation depends on OpenClaw sandbox settings.
The chat composer also includes slash commands such as `/new`, `/stop`, `/agent`, `/cwd`, `/memory`, `/cron`, `/settings`, `/export`, and `/image <prompt>` for fast local actions without leaving the keyboard.
The composer now supports direct camera capture for image attachments, and agent-requested camera use is gated by an inline user confirmation step before the camera preview opens.
Sidebar global search is available with `Ctrl/Cmd+K`, and now searches sessions, agents, pages, and cached chat-history text. Sessions can be pinned in the Sidebar, and exports remain available via `/export` and the Chat page's `Session` drawer. The Sidebar footer is now a single upload entry for quick file intake.
After reinstall or data-directory changes, KTClaw also scans current and legacy OpenClaw transcript folders so existing chat history can reappear in the session list instead of being stranded on disk.

### 🧪 Rich Markdown Rendering
Chat markdown now covers standard math rendering and KaTeX `mhchem` chemistry formulas, alongside syntax highlighting, local file links, and copy-friendly code blocks.

### 📡 Multi-Channel Management
Configure and monitor multiple AI channels simultaneously. Each channel operates independently, allowing you to run specialized agents for different tasks.
Feishu onboarding now stays inside KTClaw with one integrated wizard for plugin checks, robot create/link handoff, credential save, app-scope recovery, and QR-based user authorization.
The channel workbench also supports account-scoped management inside the current product shape: you can inspect multiple accounts per channel, switch the default account, maintain account bindings, and resolve delivery targets for channels such as Feishu, WeChat, WeCom, DingTalk, and QQ Bot through a shared backend path.
Channel-backed conversations are now isolated from the main local chat timeline, the Sidebar shows each configured account instance separately, channel-derived sessions are prefixed in the global session list, and synced conversation items can be renamed or removed from the workbench list without deleting the underlying channel account.

### Remote Intercom
Use **Settings -> Remote Instances** to configure the minimal SSH Intercom path for cross-machine agent control. A KTClaw instance can add another machine with just the remote host/IP, SSH user, optional SSH password, and target agent id; KTClaw fills the default port, session id, route id, display name, and bundled OpenClaw command unless the advanced options are expanded.
The same settings panel now checks whether this machine is ready to be controlled by another KTClaw. **Prepare this machine** can launch the OS-authorized setup flow for OpenSSH, startup, and firewall access on Windows, Linux, and macOS, then shows the host, user, port, agent id, session id, and route example another KTClaw should enter. Use **Allow remote connections** to open or close inbound SSH access without removing the installed OpenSSH/Remote Login components. The controlled machine can also copy a KTClaw connection info bundle, and the controlling machine can paste it in the route sheet to auto-fill host, SSH user, port, agent, session, and command fields. On Windows, KTClaw also regenerates `~/.openclaw/gateway.cmd` to run Gateway through the bundled Electron Node runtime, so the helper script does not depend on a separate system Node installation.
After a send attempt, the Remote Instances console renders the remote reply with the same chat bubbles used by the main Chat page, while command exit code, stdout, stderr, and duration stay available in run details for troubleshooting.
For speed, SSH Intercom first tries the remote machine's already-running KTClaw/OpenClaw Gateway from inside the SSH session, using the Gateway WebSocket `/ws` protocol first and HTTP `/rpc` only as a compatibility fallback. The route stores the remote Gateway port separately from the SSH port and defaults to `18789`; copied KTClaw connection info includes the current local Gateway port so the controlling machine does not have to guess. Normal messages are dispatched through Gateway `chat.send` in the background, the console waits up to 30 seconds for a fast reply, and then keeps polling `chat.history` so the UI can show a running state instead of blocking on a cold `openclaw agent` CLI turn. If the remote Gateway is not running, not ready yet, or listening on a different port than the route, normal messages fail fast with a diagnostic instead of cold-starting the CLI path. Structured remote tasks still retain CLI fallback where needed for compatibility and capture/tool workflows.
The console also supports **Remote task** execution over the same SSH Intercom path. A task is sent as structured `remote_task` JSON, the remote KTClaw/OpenClaw agent works locally on the remote machine, and KTClaw normalizes the result into summary, logs, artifacts, and raw SSH diagnostics.
For file workflows, selected local files are staged locally, uploaded over SFTP to `~/.ktclaw/intercom/inbox/<sender>/<taskId>/`, and referenced in the task payload. Returned artifacts are downloaded from remote outbox paths such as `~/.ktclaw/intercom/outbox/<taskId>/` into the local KTClaw artifact cache, then shown as file or image cards in the console.
Simple text-file inspection prompts, such as asking what an uploaded Markdown or text file contains, use a direct SSH preview path so they do not need to cold-start a full remote agent turn; broader analysis tasks still go through the remote KTClaw/OpenClaw agent.
Screenshot and camera capture are optimized remote-task actions. Screenshots first ask the remote KTClaw desktop client to capture the interactive desktop, then fall back to direct SSH capture utilities where available. Camera capture first asks the remote KTClaw desktop client to reuse the chat camera flow, then falls back to platform tools such as `imagesnap`, `fswebcam`, or `ffmpeg`. Both return one-shot image artifacts, not live desktop, camera, or screen sharing streams.
SSH Intercom runs non-interactively. Use **Prepare this machine** on the machine being controlled, then save either SSH key access or an optional SSH password on the controlling machine.
If key-based login is available, file upload/download falls back to the system `sftp` command so it can reuse the same SSH key and config as message sending. If key-based login is not available, save an optional SSH password on the route; KTClaw stores it in the local encrypted secret store and uses a built-in SSH/SFTP client for remote commands and transfers.
A2A Agent Card routes remain in the backend for later work, but the current settings panel keeps that flow hidden so the first usable path is Windows-to-Linux SSH. NATS/JetStream is reserved for a later reliable-queue transport. Live remote desktop, continuous screen sharing, mouse/keyboard injection, NATS transport, and WebRTC remote-helper control are not part of this stage.

### ⏰ Cron-Based Automation
Schedule AI tasks to run automatically. Define triggers, set intervals, and let your AI agents work around the clock without manual intervention.
The Cron page also includes richer run-detail panels with delivery targets, recent error context, and recent run history.
Agent detail pages now expose backend-owned cron relations and deep-link directly into the relevant Cron pipeline entry.

### 👥 Team Control Plane (MVP)
KTClaw now treats team pages as role-aware control surfaces instead of static member lists.
The `/agents` route now serves as an Employee Square: a hero-led card grid with lightweight filters, direct `Chat / Memory / Details` entry points, and a right-side create sheet for new agents.
In `Agent Detail`, each member can be configured with `teamRole` (`leader` or `worker`), `chatAccess` (`direct` or `leader_only`), and `responsibility`.
Agent dossiers now use `Overview / Memory / Skills / Activity` tabs so profile controls, shared memory access, read-only skills, and cron/activity context live in one route without turning the page back into a flat admin form.
`leader_only` is now enforced for normal direct-chat entry paths in the workbench: users are expected to route requests through the reporting leader instead of opening a direct worker chat.
Team pages also surface user-facing channel ownership and lightweight work visibility derived from the existing kanban/runtime model, so you can see who owns entry points and which members are blocked, waiting, or actively executing work.
`Team Overview` and `Team Map` now surface these semantics alongside runtime activity cues, so you can quickly identify who coordinates, who executes, and which members should be reached through leaders.
Phase 4 extends that control plane with a leader-first progress briefing in Team Overview, richer collaboration-aware Team Map nodes and drawers, and a lightweight Team Brief panel in private leader chat for quick navigation back into member detail and Kanban.
Phase 5 then refines those surfaces into a warmer leader command center: Team Overview prioritizes progress, active work, risks, and next-step guidance, while Team Map becomes a denser operations topology with a persistent task-focused rail.

### 🧩 Extensible Skill System
Extend your AI agents with pre-built skills. Browse, install, and manage skills through the integrated skill panel—no package managers required.
KTClaw also pre-bundles full document-processing skills (`pdf`, `xlsx`, `docx`, `pptx`), deploys them automatically to the managed skills directory (default `~/.openclaw/skills`) on startup, and enables them by default on first install. Additional bundled skills (`image-search`, `find-skills`, `self-improving-agent`, `tavily-search`, `brave-web-search`, `bocha-skill`) are also enabled by default; if required API keys are missing, OpenClaw will surface configuration errors in runtime.
The Skills page can display skills discovered from multiple OpenClaw sources (managed dir, workspace, and extra skill dirs), and now shows each skill's actual location so you can open the real folder directly.

Environment variables for bundled search skills:
- `BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY` for `brave-web-search`
- `TAVILY_API_KEY` for `tavily-search` (OAuth may also be supported by upstream skill runtime)
- `BOCHA_API_KEY` for `bocha-skill`
- `image-search`, `find-skills`, and `self-improving-agent` do not require API keys

Image understanding in chat requires either a vision-capable active model or an image-analysis fallback path (for example OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, or MiniMax through OpenClaw image-model/provider auth). KTClaw now warns before image sends when no such path is configured, and it nudges the agent to proactively use the relevant local skills/tools for browser, screenshot, and other multi-step tasks instead of stopping at manual instructions.
Image generation uses a DashScope provider account configured in **Settings -> AI Providers**, or the `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY` environment variable. DashScope is used only for image generation and is not offered as a Setup Wizard chat-default provider.
Local image search is available through the bundled `image-search` skill and Host API route. It works across Windows, macOS, and Linux/Kylin without relying on OS-specific indexes, and parses natural-language time/content combinations such as "yesterday's cat images", "last weekend beach photos", and "last month meeting screenshots" using file modification time by default. Visual semantic search is disabled by default. To enable `--semantic`, set `KTCLAW_IMAGE_SEARCH_ENABLE_SEMANTIC=1`; it then uses an existing local/cache `Xenova/mobileclip_s0` model, or downloads only when `KTCLAW_IMAGE_SEARCH_ALLOW_REMOTE_MODELS=1` is also set. Background vector auto-indexing at app startup is opt-in; set `KTCLAW_ENABLE_IMAGE_SEARCH_AUTO_INDEX=1` to scan the default Pictures directory automatically. When remote loading is enabled, ModelScope is tried first, then hf-mirror, then Hugging Face.

### 🔐 Secure Provider Integration
Connect to multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, and more) with credentials stored securely in your system's native keychain. OpenAI supports both API key and browser OAuth (Codex subscription) sign-in.
On Linux systems where Electron cannot access an OS keyring, KTClaw falls back to a local encoded provider-secret store so configured providers and image generation still work.

### 🌙 Adaptive Theming
Light mode, dark mode, or system-synchronized themes. KTClaw adapts to your preferences automatically.

### 🚀 Startup Launch Control
In **Settings → General**, you can enable **Launch at system startup** so KTClaw starts automatically after login.

---

## Getting Started

### System Requirements

- **Operating System**: macOS 11+, Windows 10+, or Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+)
- **Memory**: 4GB RAM minimum (8GB recommended)
- **Storage**: 1GB available disk space

### Installation

#### Pre-built Releases (Recommended)

Download the latest release for your platform from the [Releases](https://github.com/ValueCell-ai/KTClaw/releases) page.

#### Build from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ValueCell-ai/KTClaw.git
cd KTClaw

# Initialize the project
pnpm run init

# Start in development mode
pnpm dev
```
### First Launch

When you launch KTClaw for the first time, the **Setup Wizard** will guide you through:

1. **Language & Region** – Configure your preferred locale
2. **AI Provider** – Add providers with API keys or OAuth (for providers that support browser/device login)
3. **Skill Bundles** – Select pre-configured skills for common use cases
4. **Verification** – Test your configuration before entering the main interface

The wizard preselects your system language when it is supported, and falls back to English otherwise.

> Note for Moonshot (Kimi): KTClaw keeps Kimi web search enabled by default.  
> When Moonshot is configured, KTClaw also syncs Kimi web search to the China endpoint (`https://api.moonshot.cn/v1`) in OpenClaw config.

### Gateway Port

KTClaw starts the managed OpenClaw Gateway on port `18790` by default to avoid the standard OpenClaw Gateway port `18789`. If another app already uses the configured port, change it in **Settings -> Gateway Configuration**. Saving the port restarts the managed Gateway and syncs the local OpenClaw client target to `ws://127.0.0.1:<port>`.

### Proxy Settings

KTClaw includes built-in proxy settings for environments where Electron or the OpenClaw Gateway need to reach the internet through a local proxy client.

Open **Settings → Gateway → Proxy** and configure:

- **Proxy Server**: the default proxy for all requests
- **Bypass Rules**: hosts that should connect directly, separated by semicolons, commas, or new lines
- In **Developer Mode**, you can optionally override:
  - **HTTP Proxy**
  - **HTTPS Proxy**
  - **ALL_PROXY / SOCKS**

Recommended local examples:

```text
Proxy Server: http://127.0.0.1:7890
```
Notes:

- A bare `host:port` value is treated as HTTP.
- If advanced proxy fields are left empty, KTClaw falls back to `Proxy Server`.
- Saving proxy settings reapplies Electron networking immediately and restarts the Gateway automatically.
- KTClaw no longer syncs proxy settings into retired hidden channel configs.
- In **Settings → Advanced → Developer**, you can run **OpenClaw Doctor** to execute `openclaw doctor --json` and inspect the diagnostic output without leaving the app.

## Architecture

KTClaw employs a **dual-process architecture** with a unified host API layer. The renderer talks to a single client abstraction, while Electron Main owns protocol selection and process lifecycle:

```
### Design Principles

- **Process Isolation**: The AI runtime operates in a separate process, ensuring UI responsiveness even during heavy computation
- **Single Entry for Frontend Calls**: Renderer requests go through host-api/api-client; protocol details are hidden behind a stable interface
- **Main-Process Transport Ownership**: Electron Main controls WS/HTTP usage and fallback to IPC for reliability
- **Graceful Recovery**: Built-in reconnect, timeout, and backoff logic handles transient failures automatically
- **Secure Storage**: API keys and sensitive data leverage the operating system's native secure storage mechanisms
- **CORS-Safe by Design**: Local HTTP access is proxied by Main, preventing renderer-side CORS issues

```bash
pnpm run comms:replay
pnpm run comms:compare
```

`comms-regression` in CI enforces required scenarios and threshold checks.

### Accessibility & Governance Gates

When a change touches shared UI, renderer accessibility, or module boundaries, run the focused gates before pushing:

```bash
pnpm run lint:a11y
pnpm run test:a11y
pnpm run governance:check
```

`lint:a11y` currently covers the Cron, Settings, and Workbench empty-state surfaces. `test:a11y` runs the matching `vitest-axe` regressions, and `governance:check` combines `knip` with `dependency-cruiser` boundary checks.

### Codex Ralph Loop

For long-running autonomous iteration with Codex, the repository now includes a Ralph-compatible loop under `scripts/ralph/`.

Required files:

- `scripts/ralph/ralph-codex.mjs`
- `scripts/ralph/ralph-codex.sh`
- `scripts/ralph/ralph-codex.ps1`
- `scripts/ralph/CODEX.md`
- `scripts/ralph/prd.json.example`
- repository-root `prd.json`

Example commands:

```bash
pnpm run ralph:codex -- 999
bash ./scripts/ralph/ralph-codex.sh 999
bash ./scripts/ralph/ralph-codex.sh --forever
```

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\ralph\ralph-codex.ps1 999
```

The loop calls `codex exec --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox` internally and stops early once the agent emits `<promise>COMPLETE</promise>`.
